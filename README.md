# KhouryMeet
### (CS5340: Human Computer Interaction, Northeastern University, Spring 2021)

Team Members: Nicole Berg, Gerard Otalora, Marielle Riveros

## Summary

### Problem:
Since the pandemic, online classes leave students feeling isolated from their classmates, particularly when those students are new to a program. Currently students at Khoury who want to form connections need to take the initiative to introduce themselves to classmates whose names they may have seen on their course pages or in their online lectures, and this communication usually takes place over email or on a social media platform completely separate from the courses themselves. 

### Solution:
One solution we are proposing is to build an application that students can use to connect with others within their cohort. Once registered for their first semester, students will be able to use their university email to create an account on the application and customize their profiles. They will indicate the program they are studying, which will connect them to other students who are starting the same program at the same time. They will also select courses they are taking for the current semester, where they will then be able to see other students within their program also enrolled in those courses. We would also like to include a chat feature within the interface to allow students to connect to each other without needing to use a different medium.
